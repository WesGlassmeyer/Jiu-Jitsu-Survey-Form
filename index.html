      The elk or wapiti (Cervus canadensis) is one of the largest species within
      the deer family, Cervidae, and one of the largest terrestrial mammals in
      North America and Northeast Asia.
    </li>
    <li>
      Elk range in forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants,
      leaves, and bark.
    </li>
    <li>Male elk have large antlers which are shed each year.</li>
    <li>
      Males also engage in ritualized mating behaviors during the rut, including
      posturing, antler wrestling (sparring), and bugling, a loud series of
      vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts
      females.
    </li>
